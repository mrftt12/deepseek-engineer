# DeepSeek Engineer v2 üêã

## Overview

DeepSeek Engineer v2 is a powerful AI-powered coding assistant that provides an interactive terminal interface for seamless code development. It integrates with DeepSeek's advanced reasoning models to offer intelligent file operations, code analysis, and development assistance through natural conversation and function calling.

## üöÄ Latest Update: Function Calling Architecture

**Version 2.0** introduces a big upgrade from structured JSON output to native function calling, providing:
- **Natural conversations** with the AI without rigid response formats
- **Automatic file operations** through intelligent function calls
- **Real-time reasoning visibility** with Chain of Thought (CoT) capabilities
- **Enhanced reliability** and better error handling

## Key Features

### üß† **AI Capabilities**
- **Elite Software Engineering**: Decades of experience across all programming domains
- **Chain of Thought Reasoning**: Visible thought process before providing solutions
- **Code Analysis & Discussion**: Expert-level insights and optimization suggestions
- **Intelligent Problem Solving**: Automatic file reading and context understanding

### üõ†Ô∏è **Function Calling Tools**
The AI can automatically execute these operations when needed:

#### `read_file(file_path: str)`
- Read single file content with automatic path normalization
- Built-in error handling for missing or inaccessible files
- **Automatic**: AI can read any file you mention or reference in conversation

#### `read_multiple_files(file_paths: List[str])`
- Batch read multiple files efficiently
- Formatted output with clear file separators

#### `create_file(file_path: str, content: str)`
- Create new files or overwrite existing ones
- Automatic directory creation and safety checks

#### `create_multiple_files(files: List[Dict])`
- Create multiple files in a single operation
- Perfect for scaffolding projects or creating related files

#### `edit_file(file_path: str, original_snippet: str, new_snippet: str)`
- Precise snippet-based file editing
- Safe replacement with exact matching

### üìÅ **File Operations**

#### **Automatic File Reading (Recommended)**
The AI can automatically read files you mention:
```
You> Can you review the main.py file and suggest improvements?
‚Üí AI automatically calls read_file("main.py")

You> Look at src/utils.py and tests/test_utils.py
‚Üí AI automatically calls read_multiple_files(["src/utils.py", "tests/test_utils.py"])
```

#### **Manual Context Addition (Optional)**
For when you want to preload files into conversation context:
- **`/add path/to/file`** - Include single file in conversation context
- **`/add path/to/folder`** - Include entire directory (with smart filtering)

**Note**: The `/add` command is mainly useful when you want to provide extra context upfront. The AI can read files automatically via function calls whenever needed during the conversation.

### üé® **Rich Terminal Interface**
- **Color-coded feedback** (green for success, red for errors, yellow for warnings)
- **Real-time streaming** with visible reasoning process
- **Structured tables** for diff previews
- **Progress indicators** for long operations

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Safety**
- **Path normalization** and validation
- **Directory traversal protection**
- **File size limits** (5MB per file)
- **Binary file detection** and exclusion

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
sk-0bf0687f620b4ea29635e1bc358423fd
1. **DeepSeek API Key**: Get your API key from [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com)
2. **Python 3.11+**: Required for optimal performance

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd deepseek-engineer
   ```

2. **Set up environment**:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   echo "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (choose one method):

   #### Using uv (recommended - faster)
   ```bash
   uv venv
   uv run deepseek-eng.py
   ```

   #### Using pip
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 deepseek-eng.py
   ```

### Usage Examples

#### **Natural Conversation with Automatic File Operations**
```
You> Can you read the main.py file and create a test file for it?

üí≠ Reasoning: I need to first read the main.py file to understand its structure...

ü§ñ Assistant> I'll read the main.py file first to understand its structure.
‚ö° Executing 1 function call(s)...
‚Üí read_file
‚úì Read file 'main.py'

üîÑ Processing results...
Now I'll create comprehensive tests based on the code structure I found.
‚ö° Executing 1 function call(s)...
‚Üí create_file
‚úì Created/updated file at 'test_main.py'

I've analyzed main.py and created comprehensive tests covering all the main functions...
```

#### **Automatic Multi-File Analysis**
```
You> Compare the implementation in utils.py with the tests in test_utils.py

üí≠ Reasoning: I need to read both files to compare them...

ü§ñ Assistant> I'll read both files to analyze the implementation and tests.
‚ö° Executing 1 function call(s)...
‚Üí read_multiple_files
‚úì Read files: utils.py, test_utils.py

üîÑ Processing results...
After analyzing both files, I can see several areas where the tests could be improved...
```

#### **Manual Context Loading (Optional)**
```
You> /add src/

‚úì Added folder 'src/' to conversation.
üìÅ Added files: (15 files)
  üìÑ src/utils.py
  üìÑ src/models.py
  ...

You> Now review this codebase structure

ü§ñ Assistant> I've reviewed your codebase and found several areas for improvement:

1. **Error Handling**: The utils.py file could benefit from more robust error handling...
```

## File Operations Comparison

| Method | When to Use | How It Works |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Automatic Reading** | Most cases - just mention files | AI automatically calls `read_file()` when you reference files |
| **`/add` Command** | Preload context, bulk operations | Manually adds files to conversation context upfront |

**Recommendation**: Use natural conversation - the AI will automatically read files as needed. Use `/add` only when you want to provide extra context upfront.

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**API Key Not Found**
```bash
# Make sure .env file exists with your API key
echo "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
```

**Import Errors**
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync  # or pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**File Permission Errors**
- Ensure you have write permissions in the working directory
- Check file paths are correct and accessible
